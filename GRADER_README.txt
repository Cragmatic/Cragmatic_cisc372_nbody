Makefile updated. Use "make p_nbody" to compile the cuda version of this program. "make" will simply compile the serial nbody.

Executables and .o files included in the github repo were compiled on DARWIN, immediately prior to making the script and running them on DARWIN.
Script file is output.txt, as it was in the prior assignment.
